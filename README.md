# FindMyView JO

## Note:

> :exclamation: This is the new home of the FindMyView project. The code has been migrated to this repository ([link to the old one](https://github.com/noredeen-alzubi/findmyview)). The biggest changes include:
* Abandoning Webpack for Sprockets. Webpack is still set up in the codebase should it become necessary as the application grows, but is not used at the moment.
* Downgrading to Bootstrap 3 for compatability with certain important gems.
